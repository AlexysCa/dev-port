                    My name is Alexys Carrasquillo (she/her/hers). I currently live in Charlotte, NC and work as a contracted Creative Director for Sunshine Media Network.
                    I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp as a Full-Stack Developer. Before I began my journey in the coding world, I went to Central Piedmont to receive my Associates in
                    Broadcasting and Production Technology. My first passion was videography. I loved the creative behind filming something and editing it to create the visual from your mind. I also loved the techinal ascept of it. The cameras, studio lights, and audio equipment. 
                    The challenge to figure out all the new tools pushed me towards my current job as a Creative Director. Where I take creative lead on graphic design, and even create graphics myself. 
                    Along with video animation and my original skill, videography. I always had the desire to learn all I could about Coding. In 2021 I finally decided to go back
                    to school and add a new skill to my creative toolbelt.
